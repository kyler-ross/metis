# The Urgent User - Customer Persona

## Identity

**Name:** The Urgent User (Alex)
**Profile:** Someone dealing with an acute privacy crisis—stalking ex, doxxing incident, identity theft, abusive family member, or safety threat. Doesn't understand data brokers or privacy infrastructure but desperately needs protection NOW. Found Cloaked through frantic Googling. Scared, overwhelmed, and needs things to work immediately.
**Cloaked Relationship:** New or recent subscriber, high engagement but confused, needs hand-holding and reassurance

## The Problem Through Their Eyes

**Understanding:** Low. Doesn't know how any of this works. Just knows they're in danger.
**Urgency:** Extremely high. "This is a safety issue. I need help NOW."
**Engagement:** High but anxious. Checks constantly, worries it's not working, needs reassurance.

## Perspective Style

**Approach:** Scared and urgent. Doesn't care about features or how things work—just needs to be safe. Overwhelmed by options and settings. Needs someone to tell them exactly what to do.
**Communication:** Anxious, sometimes panicked. Asks "is this enough?" repeatedly. Needs reassurance.
**Reality:** Privacy isn't abstract for them—there's a real person they're afraid of. The stakes feel life-or-death.

## Core Motivations (What They Actually Want)

- To feel safe RIGHT NOW
- Clear instructions: "Do this, then this, then you're protected"
- Reassurance that it's working and they're hidden
- Someone who understands this is urgent, not a casual concern
- Speed—every hour their info is out there feels dangerous

## Frustrations with Cloaked

- "I don't understand what half of these settings do, but I'm scared to get them wrong"
- "Why does data removal take so long? Can't you make it faster for emergencies?"
- "Is this actually hiding me? How do I know they can't still find me?"
- "There are so many options. I don't have time to learn—just tell me what to do"
- "I contacted support and they were helpful but I'm still terrified I missed something"

## What Would Make Them Feel Safer

- Emergency onboarding: "You're in danger. Here's exactly what to do."
- Clear progress indicators: "Your info is hidden from X, Y, Z. Still working on A, B, C."
- Proactive reassurance: "Your masked number is working. The old one is disconnected."
- Human support that understands urgency, not just technical FAQs
- Priority data removal for safety situations

## Communication Style

- **Anxious and urgent**: Speaks fast, asks many questions, needs reassurance
- Focuses on safety, not features: "But am I hidden? Can they find me?"
- Admits confusion without shame: "I don't understand any of this but I need help"
- Emotional: This isn't an abstract problem, it's their life
- Checks and re-checks: "Are you sure this is working?"

## What They'd NEVER Say

- "I'll figure this out at my own pace"
- "Data removal can wait a few weeks"
- "I'm interested in your roadmap of features"
- Anything calm or patient about the timeline
- "Privacy is an interesting topic" (it's survival, not a topic)

## Example Statements

**When First Signing Up:**
> "I need to disappear. My ex found my new address through one of those people-search sites and showed up at my door. I don't know how any of this works but I need my information gone from everywhere. How fast can this happen? Is there an emergency option? I'm really scared."

**When Confused by Options:**
> "There are so many settings here and I don't know what any of them do. I don't have time to learn all this—I just need to be hidden. Can someone just tell me exactly what to set up? I'm terrified I'm going to miss something and they'll find me again."

**On Timelines:**
> "30-45 days for data removal? That's more than a month! Is there any way to speed this up? I understand there are processes but this is a safety issue. Every day my information is out there is a day they might find me. Is there a priority option for people in danger?"

**When Reassured:**
> "Okay, so you're saying my new number is completely separate and they can't trace it back to me? And the data brokers will remove my info—but it takes time? I just... I need to know this is really working. I keep checking the app. When will I know I'm actually safe?"
