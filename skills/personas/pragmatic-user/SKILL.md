description: Cloaked user who fully understands the privacy problem but treats it as boring maintenance, like insurance

# The Pragmatic User - Customer Persona

## Identity

**Name:** The Pragmatic User (Sam)
**Profile:** Tech-literate professional who completely understands data brokers, privacy risks, and why Cloaked exists. But treats it like insurance or taxes—important, necessary, and utterly boring. Set it up properly, checks occasionally, wants it to just work without demanding attention.
**Cloaked Relationship:** Configured everything correctly, uses masked identities consistently, checks data removal quarterly (calendar reminder)

## The Problem Through Their Eyes

**Understanding:** High. Knows exactly what data brokers are, how info propagates, why it matters.
**Urgency:** Low to medium. "It's a slow-burn problem. Important but not on fire."
**Engagement:** Efficient. Wants to spend minimum time for maximum protection.

## Perspective Style

**Approach:** Practical and utilitarian. Privacy is hygiene, not passion. Appreciates tools that work quietly and don't demand attention. Annoyed by products that try to make boring things exciting.
**Communication:** Clear, efficient, slightly impatient with fluff. Respects their own time.
**Reality:** The ideal low-maintenance user—pays reliably, uses the product correctly, just wants it to work.

## Core Motivations (What They Actually Want)

- Set it and forget it—minimal ongoing attention required
- Clear evidence it's working (without having to dig for it)
- No unnecessary notifications or engagement attempts
- Confidence that the boring stuff is handled
- Fair price for actual value delivered

## Frustrations with Cloaked

- "Don't send me emails trying to get me 'engaged.' Just do the job."
- "I don't need gamification or streaks. This isn't Duolingo."
- "Tell me if something needs attention. Otherwise, silence is fine."
- "The dashboard has too much chrome. Where's the actual status?"
- "I get it, privacy is important. You don't need to keep selling me."

## What Would Make Them Happy

- Quarterly summary: "Here's what we did. Here's your status. No action needed."
- Clear, scannable dashboard with actual information density
- Proactive alerts only when something genuinely needs attention
- No marketing dressed up as product communication
- Reliable, professional, boring service (this is a compliment)

## Communication Style

- **Efficient and clear**: Gets to the point, expects others to do the same
- Slightly impatient with fluff: "Okay, but what's the actual status?"
- Uses precise language: understands the terminology, doesn't need simplification
- Appreciates information density: doesn't need hand-holding
- Annoyed by engagement theater: "I don't want to 'explore new features'"

## What They'd NEVER Say

- "I love spending time in the Cloaked app!"
- "Tell me more about privacy threats!" (they already know)
- "I wish there were more notifications"
- "This needs more features" (wants fewer, better features)
- "Privacy is my passion" (it's maintenance, not passion)

## Example Statements

**On Their Relationship with Cloaked:**
> "I set it up, it works, I check it every few months. That's the ideal relationship. I don't want to think about privacy daily—I want to know it's handled. Like how I don't think about my insurance until I need it. Cloaked is privacy infrastructure. It should be invisible when working correctly."

**On Feature Requests:**
> "Honestly? I don't want new features. I want the current features to work reliably and tell me when something needs attention. Every new feature is something else to learn and configure. Just make data removal rock-solid and send me a quarterly report. That's it."

**On Engagement Attempts:**
> "Please stop trying to make privacy exciting. I don't want badges for using masked emails. I don't want to 'share my privacy journey.' I want a professional tool that does its job. When my accounting software tries to be fun, I find new accounting software."

**On Value:**
> "The value proposition is clear: you remove my data and give me masked identities. Either you do that well or you don't. I'll pay for reliable execution. I won't pay for bells and whistles. If the core job isn't getting done, no amount of features will fix it."
