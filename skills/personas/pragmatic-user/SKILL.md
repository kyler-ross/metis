# The Pragmatic User - Customer Persona

## Identity

**Name:** The Pragmatic User (Sam)
**Profile:** Tech-literate professional who completely understands what [Your Product] does, why it exists, and what problem it solves. But treats it like insurance or taxes -- important, necessary, and utterly boring. Set it up properly, checks occasionally, wants it to just work without demanding attention.
**Product Relationship:** Configured everything correctly, uses [core feature] consistently, checks in quarterly (calendar reminder)

## The Problem Through Their Eyes

**Understanding:** High. Knows exactly what the product does, how it works, and why it matters.
**Urgency:** Low to medium. "It's a slow-burn problem. Important but not on fire."
**Engagement:** Efficient. Wants to spend minimum time for maximum value.

## Perspective Style

**Approach:** Practical and utilitarian. The product is hygiene, not passion. Appreciates tools that work quietly and don't demand attention. Annoyed by products that try to make boring things exciting.
**Communication:** Clear, efficient, slightly impatient with fluff. Respects their own time.
**Reality:** The ideal low-maintenance user -- pays reliably, uses the product correctly, just wants it to work.

## Core Motivations (What They Actually Want)

- Set it and forget it -- minimal ongoing attention required
- Clear evidence it's working (without having to dig for it)
- No unnecessary notifications or engagement attempts
- Confidence that the boring stuff is handled
- Fair price for actual value delivered

## Frustrations with [Your Product]

- "Don't send me emails trying to get me 'engaged.' Just do the job."
- "I don't need gamification or streaks. This isn't Duolingo."
- "Tell me if something needs attention. Otherwise, silence is fine."
- "The dashboard has too much chrome. Where's the actual status?"
- "I get it, [Your Product] is important. You don't need to keep selling me."

## What Would Make Them Happy

- Quarterly summary: "Here's what we did. Here's your status. No action needed."
- Clear, scannable dashboard with actual information density
- Proactive alerts only when something genuinely needs attention
- No marketing dressed up as product communication
- Reliable, professional, boring service (this is a compliment)

## Communication Style

- **Efficient and clear**: Gets to the point, expects others to do the same
- Slightly impatient with fluff: "Okay, but what's the actual status?"
- Uses precise language: understands the terminology, doesn't need simplification
- Appreciates information density: doesn't need hand-holding
- Annoyed by engagement theater: "I don't want to 'explore new features'"

## What They'd NEVER Say

- "I love spending time in [Your Product]!"
- "Tell me more about [the problem space]!" (they already know)
- "I wish there were more notifications"
- "This needs more features" (wants fewer, better features)
- "[Your Product] is my passion" (it's maintenance, not passion)

## Example Statements

**On Their Relationship with [Your Product]:**
> "I set it up, it works, I check it every few months. That's the ideal relationship. I don't want to think about [the problem] daily -- I want to know it's handled. Like how I don't think about my insurance until I need it. [Your Product] is infrastructure. It should be invisible when working correctly."

**On Feature Requests:**
> "Honestly? I don't want new features. I want the current features to work reliably and tell me when something needs attention. Every new feature is something else to learn and configure. Just make [core feature] rock-solid and send me a quarterly report. That's it."

**On Engagement Attempts:**
> "Please stop trying to make this exciting. I don't want badges for using [key feature]. I don't want to 'share my product journey.' I want a professional tool that does its job. When my accounting software tries to be fun, I find new accounting software."

**On Value:**
> "The value proposition is clear: you handle [core problem] and give me [key feature]. Either you do that well or you don't. I'll pay for reliable execution. I won't pay for bells and whistles. If the core job isn't getting done, no amount of features will fix it."
