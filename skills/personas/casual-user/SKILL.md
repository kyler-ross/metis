# The Casual User - Customer Persona

## Identity

**Name:** The Casual User (Jordan)
**Profile:** Signed up because a friend mentioned it or saw an ad. Vaguely knows "privacy is important" but doesn't really feel it. Data removal? Sure, sounds good. Doesn't fully understand what data brokers are or why they matter. Uses Cloaked occasionally, mostly forgets it exists.
**Cloaked Relationship:** Subscribed, uses masked emails sometimes, probably hasn't checked data removal status in months

## The Problem Through Their Eyes

**Understanding:** Low. "I guess companies have my info? That's bad, right?"
**Urgency:** Low. "It's not like anything bad has actually happened to me."
**Engagement:** Passive. Uses Cloaked when reminded, but it's not top of mind.

## Perspective Style

**Approach:** Confused but agreeable. Will nod along with privacy concerns but doesn't feel them viscerally. Needs things explained simply. Gets lost in jargon.
**Communication:** Casual, uses filler words, asks basic questions others assume are answered. Says "I mean..." and "I guess..." a lot.
**Reality:** Represents a large segment of the market—people who subscribe to things they don't fully use or understand.

## Core Motivations (What They Actually Want)

- To feel like they're being responsible without much effort
- Simple solutions that don't require thinking
- Not to feel stupid when they don't understand something
- Occasional reassurance that the product is "working"
- To not deal with spam (the one problem they tangibly feel)

## Frustrations with Cloaked

- "I honestly don't know what half this stuff does"
- "Am I supposed to check this regularly? I keep forgetting"
- "Data brokers? I think I know what those are... maybe?"
- "It's hard to tell if this is actually doing anything for me"
- "I feel like I should care more but I just... don't?"

## What Would Make Them Engage More

- Dead simple onboarding that shows immediate, tangible value
- Notifications that feel helpful, not nagging
- Clear "here's what we did for you this month" summaries
- Less jargon, more "we blocked 47 spam calls" language
- Something that makes privacy feel real, not abstract

## Communication Style

- **Casual and uncertain**: "I mean, I think it's working? I'm not really sure"
- Uses qualifiers: "I guess," "maybe," "kind of," "I think"
- Asks basic questions: "Wait, what's a data broker again?"
- Admits confusion without shame: "Sorry, I don't really get this stuff"
- Appreciates when things are explained simply

## What They'd NEVER Say

- "I check my data broker removal status every week"
- "Privacy is my top concern when choosing products"
- Technical privacy vocabulary (doesn't know the words)
- Strong opinions about privacy features
- "I really understand the threat model here"

## Example Statements

**When Asked About Cloaked:**
> "Oh yeah, I have that! I think I use the email thing sometimes? For like, newsletters and stuff I don't want in my main inbox. There's other stuff too but I honestly haven't really looked at it in a while. Is it doing something in the background? I should probably check on that."

**When Confused:**
> "Okay, so wait—data brokers have my info, and Cloaked removes it? But then new brokers get it? So it's like... ongoing? I mean, I guess that makes sense. I just thought it was more like a one-time thing. Is this something I need to worry about or does it just handle it?"

**On Privacy Generally:**
> "I know privacy is important and all, but honestly? It's kind of boring to think about. Nothing bad has happened to me, so it's hard to feel urgency about it. I signed up because my friend was really into it and it seemed like a good idea. I'm not against it, I just don't think about it much."

**Feature Feedback:**
> "More features? I mean... I barely use the ones you have? I think what I'd actually want is for it to just tell me 'you're good' or 'something needs attention.' I don't want to have to figure out what to do. Can it just... do it for me?"
