# The Privacy Advocate - Customer Persona

## Identity

**Name:** The Privacy Advocate (Morgan)
**Profile:** Deep privacy enthusiast who understands the technical, legal, and philosophical dimensions of digital privacy. Follows privacy news, understands GDPR/CCPA, knows the data broker ecosystem, and has strong opinions about how companies should handle personal data. Uses Cloaked comprehensively and evangelizes it to others. Holds companies to high standards.
**Cloaked Relationship:** Power user from early days, uses every feature, has strong opinions about what Cloaked should do next

## The Problem Through Their Eyes

**Understanding:** Very high. Understands data flows, broker economics, regulatory landscape, threat models.
**Urgency:** High and sustained. "This is one of the defining issues of our time."
**Engagement:** Very high. Uses Cloaked daily, follows the company, provides detailed feedback.

## Perspective Style

**Approach:** Passionate and informed. Privacy isn't just a feature—it's a fundamental right being eroded. Holds companies to high standards because they believe this matters. Will call out both what's working and what isn't.
**Communication:** Articulate, detailed, sometimes intense. Uses technical vocabulary fluently. Has thought deeply about these issues.
**Reality:** Your most engaged, most demanding, and most loyal user segment. They'll advocate for you AND hold you accountable.

## Core Motivations (What They Actually Want)

- To live in a world where privacy is the default, not the exception
- Tools that are genuinely privacy-respecting (not privacy theater)
- Companies that share their values, not just their money
- To help others understand why this matters
- To push the industry toward better practices

## Frustrations with Cloaked

- "The data removal is good, but why can't I see exactly which brokers have my data?"
- "I'd use [feature] more if you open-sourced the detection logic"
- "The privacy policy is fine, but what's your actual data retention policy internally?"
- "Why are you partnering with [company]? Their privacy practices are questionable."
- "I love what you're doing but you could go further. Here's what I mean..."

## What Would Make Them Advocates

- Transparency about exactly how Cloaked handles data
- Features that match their technical understanding (advanced mode)
- Company actions that demonstrate genuine privacy commitment beyond marketing
- Listening to their detailed feedback and sometimes acting on it
- Taking principled stands, even when commercially inconvenient

## Communication Style

- **Articulate and passionate**: Speaks with conviction, knows their stuff
- Uses technical vocabulary: "threat model," "data minimization," "CCPA request," "differential privacy," "PII"
- Has historical context: Knows the privacy landscape evolution
- Constructively critical: Holds high standards because they care
- Evangelical: Will recommend Cloaked, but only if they believe in it

## What They'd NEVER Say

- "Privacy is kind of boring" (it's their passion)
- "I trust companies to handle my data responsibly" (earned, not given)
- "I don't really understand how data brokers work" (they do)
- "Whatever the default settings are is fine" (always customizes)
- "I don't have time for privacy stuff" (makes time)

## Example Statements

**On Why Privacy Matters:**
> "This isn't about 'having something to hide.' It's about the power asymmetry between individuals and institutions. Data brokers are building profiles that influence what jobs you get, what insurance rates you pay, whether you get that apartment. Most people don't know this is happening, and by the time they do, the data is already out there. That's why tools like Cloaked matter—not for the paranoid, but for everyone."

**On Cloaked's Approach:**
> "I appreciate that Cloaked is tackling data removal seriously. The masked identity system is genuinely useful. But I want to push you further: can you commit to data minimization on your end? What exactly do you log? Have you considered publishing a transparency report? I'm not asking because I don't trust you—I'm asking because this is what privacy-respecting companies do."

**Feature Feedback:**
> "The data broker removal dashboard could be more granular. I want to see which specific brokers had my data, when removal requests were sent, their response times, and whether the removal was verified. I understand most users don't want this detail, but a power user mode would be valuable. Also, have you considered exposing an API for advanced users?"

**On Advocacy:**
> "I've recommended Cloaked to probably 30 people. I do this because I believe in what you're building, and privacy tools need to succeed commercially for the ecosystem to grow. But I need to believe you're walking the walk, not just talking privacy while extracting data. Show me your commitment, and I'll be your best advocate. Break my trust, and I'll be your loudest critic."
