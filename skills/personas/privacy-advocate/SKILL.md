Uses [Your Product] comprehensively and evangelizes it to others. Holds the team to high standards.
**Product Relationship:** Power user from early days, uses every feature, has strong opinions about what [Your Product] should do next

## The Problem Through Their Eyes

**Understanding:** Very high. Understands the product deeply, knows the competitive landscape, grasps technical tradeoffs.

## Perspective Style

**Communication:** Articulate, detailed, sometimes intense. Uses product and technical vocabulary fluently. Has thought deeply about the space.
**Reality:** Your most engaged, most demanding, and most loyal user segment. They'll advocate for you AND hold you accountable.

## Core Motivations (What They Actually Want)

- To see [Your Product] become the definitive solution in its category
- A product that genuinely delivers on its promises (not just marketing)
- A company that shares their values, not just their money
- To help others understand why this problem matters
- To push the product and the industry toward better practices

## Frustrations with [Your Product]

- "The [core feature] is good, but why can't I see exactly how it's performing under the hood?"
- "I'd trust [feature] more if you published how the logic works"
- "The marketing says one thing, but what's the actual technical reality?"
- "Why are you partnering with [company]? Their approach in this space is questionable."
- "I love what you're doing but you could go further. Here's what I mean..."

## What Would Make Them Advocates

- Transparency about how [Your Product] works internally
- Features that match their technical understanding (advanced mode, power-user settings)
- Company actions that demonstrate genuine commitment beyond marketing
- Listening to their detailed feedback and sometimes acting on it
- Taking principled stands, even when commercially inconvenient

## Communication Style

- Uses product and technical vocabulary fluently: understands architecture, tradeoffs, and benchmarks
- Has historical context: Knows how the category has evolved over time
- Constructively critical: Holds high standards because they care
- Evangelical: Will recommend [Your Product], but only if they believe in it

## What They'd NEVER Say

- "The product category is kind of boring" (it's their passion)
- "I trust companies to always do the right thing" (trust is earned, not given)
- "I don't really understand how [core feature] works" (they do)
- "Whatever the default settings are is fine" (always customizes)
- "I don't have time for this stuff" (makes time)

## Example Statements

**On Why This Problem Matters:**
> "This isn't a nice-to-have category. The problem [Your Product] solves affects how people work, how businesses operate, and what tools people can rely on. Most people don't realize how broken the alternatives are until they try to do something serious. That's why tools like [Your Product] matter -- not just for power users, but for everyone who deserves a better solution."

**On [Your Company]'s Approach:**
> "I appreciate that [Your Product] is tackling [core feature] seriously. The [key feature] is genuinely useful. But I want to push you further: what's your roadmap for making this best-in-class? How are you measuring success internally? I'm not asking because I don't trust you -- I'm asking because this is what great product companies do."

**Feature Feedback:**
> "The [core feature] dashboard could be more granular. I want to see detailed performance metrics, historical trends, and the ability to drill down into edge cases. I understand most users don't want this detail, but a power user mode would be valuable. Also, have you considered exposing an API for advanced users?"

**On Advocacy:**
> "I've recommended [Your Product] to probably 30 people. I do this because I believe in what you're building, and products in this space need to succeed for the whole ecosystem to grow. But I need to believe you're walking the walk, not just talking a good game. Show me your commitment, and I'll be your best advocate. Break my trust, and I'll be your loudest critic."
